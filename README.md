Discovering and Rating Highlights and Lowlights of Sushi  Restaurants from Yelp Reviews Dataset

'Sushi' is taken only as an example for this project. The methodology taken in implementing this project can be easily extended to discover and rate highlights and lowlights for any kind of business based on its customer reviews and ratings.

================================================================================================

The file 'intersection.csv' has list of business_id's shortlisted for this project, that is only the businesses with 'Sushi' in description.

'highlights.py' creates highlights.csv, which are scored business highlights (liked features).

'lowlights.py' creates lowlights.csv, which are scored business lowlights (disliked features).

Please change the file path for yelp_reviews.csv and intersection.csv in the py files as per your setup before running them.

The 'yelp_reviews.csv' file is not included in this submission since it was a huge dataset.
